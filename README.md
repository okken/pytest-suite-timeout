# pytest-suite-timeout

A pytest plugin for ensuring max suite time.

Really though, it's: if the timeout expires, no new tests are started.

----

## A use case

Works great in conjunction with [pytest-repeat](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat).

Say your debugging a flaky test and just want to run it a bunch of times, but not longer than say 10 minutes.

After installing both `pytest-repeat` and `pytest-suite-timeout` you can say:

```
$ pytest test_something.py::test_func --count=1000 --suite-timeout=10
```

That will run a test 1000 times, if that's less than 10 minutes.
If it takes longer than 10 minutes, it will exit pytest after 10 minutes-ish.


## Installation

From PyPI:

```
$ pip install pytest-suite-timeout
```

## Usage


Specify the max suite time with `--suite-timeout`, in minutes (float).

Example of max 1.5 minutes:

```
$ pytest --suite-timeout=1.5 
```

## Defaults to no timeout

If you don't pass in `--suite-timeout`, nothing happens.

## Timeout behavior

Timeout is done between tests. 
If a timeout is noticed, `pytest.exit()` is called, stopping all further testing.
